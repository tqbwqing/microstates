%% KMEANS_FAST carries out the fast KMEANS algorithm of Charles Elkan.
%
%  Discussion:
%
%    Note that if the input quantity INITCENTERS is a scalar, it is taken
%    to be the number of clusters desired, but if it is a KxM array, it is]
%    taken to be the M-dimensional coordinates of K points, to be used as
%    initial guesses for the cluster centers.

%
%  Parameters:
%
%    Input, real DATA(N,M), the M-dimensional coordinates of N points.
%
%    Input, integer INITCENTERS, the number K of clusters desired.
%
%    Input, real INITCENTERS(K,M), the M-dimensional coordinates of K
%    points, which the program will use as starting guesses for the 
%    cluster centers.
%
%    Input, integer METHOD, selects the algorithm to be used.
%    * 0, unoptimized, using n by k matrix of distances O(nk) space;
%    * 1, vectorized, using only O(n+k) space;
%    * 2, like 1, in addition using distance inequalities (default).
%
%    Output, real CENTERS(K,M), the M-dimensional coordinates of the K 
%    cluster centers.
%
%    Output, integer MINCENTER(N,1), the index, for each data point, of
%    the cluster to which it belongs.
%
%    Output, real MINDIST(N,1), an upper bound of the distance of each point to
%    the nearest center.
%
%    Output, real Q2, the mean of UDIST^2.
%
%    Output, real QUALITY, the mean of UDIST.
